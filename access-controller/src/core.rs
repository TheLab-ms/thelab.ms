//! Pure access-control decision state machine.
//!
//! This is a mechanical extraction of the body of `access_task` in
//! `src/main.rs`. All side effects (door pulse, reader feedback, event
//! buffer push, sync request, watchdog feed) are returned as an `Effect`
//! enum instead of being performed directly, and all time is taken as an
//! explicit `u64` (milliseconds since boot) parameter rather than read from
//! `embassy_time::Instant::now()`. The cache is taken as a slice rather than
//! a `Mutex` lock.
//!
//! This makes the firmware's authorization decisions deterministically
//! testable from host tests under `cargo test --features sim`, without
//! changing observable runtime behavior in the firmware.
//!
//! The firmware adapter in `main.rs` is responsible for:
//! - selecting on `WIEGAND_CHANNEL` / `SYNC_COMPLETE` / `WATCHDOG_FEED` and
//!   mapping each to the corresponding `Input` variant,
//! - calling `embassy_time::Instant::now().as_millis()` and passing it in,
//! - locking the `FOBS` mutex and passing a slice,
//! - dispatching each returned `Effect` to the corresponding `Signal` or
//!   the global `EVENT_BUFFER`.
