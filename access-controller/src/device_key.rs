//! Per-device root key + HKDF-derived per-partition sub-keys for at-rest
//! encryption of the `nvs` (settings), `fobs`, and `cache` partitions.
//!
//! ## Threat model
//!
//! Defends against an attacker that has physical custody of a powered-down
//! device and can run `espflash read-flash` to dump the SPI flash chip.
//! With this module enabled, the dump yields only ciphertext for the two
//! protected partitions; the WiFi PSK and local fob list cannot be
//! recovered from flash alone.
//!
//! Does **NOT** defend against:
//!   * `espefuse.py summary` over UART download mode — this returns the
//!     BLOCK3 root key in cleartext because BLOCK3 read-protection (RD_DIS
//!     bit) is *not* set (it cannot be, because we need the CPU to read
//!     the bytes to derive the AEAD key — the ESP32 classic AES peripheral
//!     does not have a BLOCK3 key-feeder, unlike S2/S3/C3).
//!   * Anyone with code execution on the running device (they can read the
//!     derived keys from RAM).
//!   * Modified/malicious firmware (OTA is unsigned — separate issue).
//!
//! For threat models that include UART-bootloader attackers, enable the
//! ESP32 native flash-encryption + Secure-Boot-v1 stack instead; that
//! moves the root key into BLOCK1/BLOCK2 where even the CPU cannot read
//! it (only the flash-encryption peripheral consumes it).
//!
//! ## Provisioning
//!
//! Per-device key lives in eFuse BLOCK3 (32 bytes, 256 bits). The firmware
//! **self-provisions on first boot**: [`auto_provision`] reads BLOCK3, and
//! if it is still blank (virgin silicon) it generates 256 bits from the
//! hardware TRNG and burns them into BLOCK3 via the eFuse programming
//! registers. No external script or host tooling is required — power on a
//! fresh unit and it provisions itself, then [`init`] derives the sub-keys
//! on that same boot.
//!
//! eFuse BLOCK3 is one-time-writable (OTP), so [`auto_provision`] only ever
//! burns when the block reads back all-zero; on an already-provisioned unit
//! it is a no-op. The burn is guarded further by:
//!   * a coding-scheme check (raw 32-byte writes are only valid under
//!     coding scheme NONE; 3/4 and repeat encodings are refused), and
//!   * a post-burn readback verify (the derived key is only trusted if the
//!     bytes read back equal what we burned).
//!
//! The legacy operator script `tools/provision-device-key.sh` (host-side
//! `espefuse.py burn_block_data`) still works and remains as a fallback for
//! the rare case where self-provisioning is refused (e.g. unsupported
//! coding scheme); see `tools/README.md`.
//!
//! If a burn is ever refused or fails verification, [`state()`] returns
//! [`KeyState::Unprovisioned`] and all three stores degrade safely: loads
//! return empty, saves return an error that is surfaced in the HTTP UI
//! and logs.
//!
//! ### Threat note on self-generated entropy
//!
//! The root key is produced by [`esp_hal::rng::Trng`], which mixes SAR-ADC
//! noise (via [`esp_hal::rng::TrngSource`]) on top of the RF-derived noise
//! already present once `esp_radio::init()` has run. [`auto_provision`]
//! MUST therefore be called after radio init so the RNG is a true TRNG and
//! not a boot-deterministic PRNG.
//!
//! ## Derivation
//!
//! Per-partition sub-keys are derived via HKDF-SHA256, with the MAC as
//! salt (public, but provides domain separation between identical
//! firmware builds on different units) and a per-partition `info` label:
//!
//! ```text
//! K_fobs     = HKDF-SHA256(ikm = BLOCK3, salt = mac6, info = "conway/fobs/v1")
//! K_settings = HKDF-SHA256(ikm = BLOCK3, salt = mac6, info = "conway/settings/v1")
//! K_cache    = HKDF-SHA256(ikm = BLOCK3, salt = mac6, info = "conway/cache/v1")
//! ```
//!
//! Sub-keys are cached at boot in a set of `static mut [u8; 32]` arrays
//! guarded by an `AtomicU8` state flag with Release/Acquire ordering.
//! [`init`] is a single-shot called pre-task-spawn during boot: it writes
//! the bytes, then publishes `ST_READY` with a Release store; accessor
//! functions ([`fobs_key`], [`settings_key`], [`cache_key`]) load the state with Acquire
//! and only dereference the statics once they observe `ST_READY`. Once
//! published the bytes are immutable for the lifetime of the process.
//! This is logically equivalent to a write-once cell but avoids pulling
//! in `OnceCell`/`once_cell` for two fixed-size byte arrays.
//! The BLOCK3 IKM is held in a `Zeroizing<[u8; 32]>` and wiped as soon
//! as HKDF returns.
